# ParallelProgramming

These programs show various parallel programs with OpenMP, Cuda, Erlang, and C(pthreads). 

Additionally, there are timing statements that discuss speedup when processors are added. Except for Erlang, all tests were done via ssh'ing into a supercomputer. Additionally, the offsite location used for testing had GPUs as well, thus the Cuda code.
